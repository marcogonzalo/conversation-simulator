# Memory Bank Instructions

## Purpose

The Memory Bank is a structured knowledge base that captures and organizes project information, decisions, and context. It serves as a single source of truth for the project's evolution, helping maintain consistency and continuity across development sessions.

## Structure

The Memory Bank consists of several core files, each serving a specific purpose:

### Core Files (Required)

1. **`memory_bank_instructions.md`** - This file, containing instructions for using the Memory Bank
2. **`projectbrief.md`** - Foundation document defining core requirements and goals
3. **`productContext.md`** - Why the project exists, problems it solves, user experience goals
4. **`activeContext.md`** - Current work focus, recent changes, next steps, active decisions
5. **`systemPatterns.md`** - System architecture, technical decisions, design patterns
6. **`techContext.md`** - Technologies used, development setup, constraints, dependencies
7. **`progress.md`** - What works, what's left to build, current status, known issues

## Usage Guidelines

- **Update regularly**: Keep information current as the project evolves
- **Be specific**: Include concrete details, not just high-level concepts
- **Document decisions**: Capture the reasoning behind important choices
- **Maintain accuracy**: Ensure details reflect the actual project state
- **Cross-reference**: Link related information across files when relevant

## File Maintenance

- Review and update files at the start of each major development session
- Update `activeContext.md` frequently to reflect current work
- Update `progress.md` when completing milestones or discovering issues
- Update `systemPatterns.md` when making architectural changes
- Update `techContext.md` when adding or changing technologies

## Best Practices

- Use clear, concise language
- Include relevant code snippets or configuration examples
- Document both what works and what doesn't
- Capture lessons learned and insights
- Maintain a consistent format across all files
